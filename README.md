# Pneumonia Detection and Localization

This repository contains code for a two-part model for detection and localization of pneumonia on x-ray images. Detection is done using a self-made CNN (built in PyTorch) trained on Google Colab, and localization is done using the pre-trained YOLOv3 model - available on https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/.

Training and testing was done using the images from RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge - https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge.
